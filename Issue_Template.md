Thank you for your interest in the grunt-webfont!

This project is powered by you, the user, which means I, the author, can’t answer support questions, fix non-critical bugs and implement feature requests.

But I can:

- review your pull request,
- publish a new release,
- give you push access if you want to maintain the project.
